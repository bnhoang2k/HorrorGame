# Deprivation

This is our final project for CSCI 577, Advanced Game Development, Spring 2024. You wake up in pitch-black room, and you have to find your way out. You're not alone, and the twist is that you don't have a complete set of senses. You'll have to creatively navigate the environment to escape.
