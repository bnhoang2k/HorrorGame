Thanks for buying the Ouija Spirit Board from TPG Games!

To use this asset just follow this simple instructions:

- Import the package to your project and drag and drop the board and planchette prefabs to your scene.

- Select the board and in the inspector drag the planchette from the Hierarchy to the "Marker" space in the Ouija script. 

That's it, it's ready to use, you can test it by just writing something in the "test" field on the script and hitting play on Unity.

From the script on the inspector you can also change the "Marker Speed" and the "Transition Time".
The marker speed is the speed of the marker between letters.
The transition time, is how much time the marker will stay on a letter before going to the next position.

In order to call the ouija from any part of your game you need to use the CallSpell() method from the Ouija script, this function receives a string as a parameter, so you only need to call it with any message you want, lower or uppercase is the same.
There are a few special symbols on the board, you can use them as follows:

YES = "+"
NO = "-"
Center of the board = "*"
GOOD BYE = "@"

For repeating letters you should use * between them, for example to write "HELLO" you should pass as a parameter "hel*lo"
You can find a demo scene on the package to see a few examples on how to use the board.

The board is on a 1:1 scale with a size of 0,45x0,30x0,02 unity units. You can scale it from the transform property of the gameobject if you need it bigger.

That's it, you are ready to start contacting the dead!
